# Emotion Detection Using LSTM

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting emotions in textual data using a deep learning model built with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. By analyzing tweets, comments, or messages, the model predicts emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and love. The primary goal is to provide a system that can analyze text and classify the underlying emotion, which has applications in sentiment analysis, mental health monitoring, and customer feedback analysis.

## Dataset
Source: The dataset contains textual data (e.g., tweets, comments, or messages) paired with corresponding emotion labels.
Size: 20,000 samples.
Labels: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, and Love.
Structure:
Text: The actual content of the tweet or comment.
Label: The emotion associated with the text.

## Project Workflow
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gain insights into the dataset through statistical analysis and visualizations.
- **Text Cleaning:** Preprocessing of comments, including removing special characters, stopwords, and performing tokenization.
- **Model Training:** Built an LSTM model to capture sequential patterns in the text.
Used pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., GloVe or FastText) for vector representation.
Optimized hyperparameters to improve accuracy and avoid overfitting.
- **Architecture:**
  - Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vectors.
  - LSTM Layers: Processes the sequential data.
  - Dense Layers: Classifies the final output into emotion labels.
